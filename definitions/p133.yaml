  description: "Processes running within pods that need to contact the API server must verify the API servers serving certificate. Failing to do so could be a subject to man-in-the-middle attacks. Providing the root certificate for the API servers serving certificate to the controller manager with the --root-ca-file argument allows the controller manager to inject the trusted bundle into pods so that they can verify TLS connections to the API server."
