  description: "The connections from the apiserver to the kubelet are used for fetching logs for pods, attaching (through kubectl) to running pods, and using the kubelet\u2019s port-forwarding functionality. These connections terminate at the kubelet\u2019s HTTPS endpoint. By default, the apiserver does not verify the kubelet\u2019s serving certificate, which makes the connection subject to man-in-the-middle attacks, and unsafe to run over untrusted and/or public networks. Enabling Kubelet certificate authentication ensures that the apiserver could authenticate the Kubelet before submitting any requests."
